Query: Get Request Parameters in a Servlet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 When in doubt, always go to the http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/servlet-3.0-fr-eval-oth-JSpec/. In this case, see chapter  9.1.1 Query Strings in Request Dispatcher Paths  

 
   The  ServletContext  and  ServletRequest  methods that create
   RequestDispatcher   objects using path information  allow the optional
  attachment of query string  information to the path . For example, a
  Developer may obtain a  RequestDispatcher   by using the following code: 

  String path = "/raisins.jsp?orderno=5"; 
RequestDispatcher rd = context.getRequestDispatcher(path;    
rd.include(request, response;
  
  
   Parameters specified in the query string used to create the
   RequestDispatcher  take precedence over other parameters of the same
  name passed to the included servlet.  The parameters associated with a
   RequestDispatcher  are scoped to apply only for  the duration of the
  include or forward call.  
 

   

  RequestDispatcher rd = getServletContext(.getRequestDispatcher("/report?p="+value;
rd.forward(request, response;   
  

 And the parameter  p  will be available only for  HttpServletRequest  that is given to the resource mapped to handle the specified path, ie.  /report  in this case. If that is a  HttpServlet , you can then access it with  

  request.getParameter("p";
  

 where  request  would be the  HttpServletRequest  method parameter. 

 When the  forward(..  call terminates and execution comes back to your  PreProcessingServlet , the parameter will no longer be available in the local  HttpServletRequest  object.

 You can receive the parameters you submit in the form with the method: 

 request.getParameter("fieldname"); 

 For intance, your servlet could get all the fields: 

   @Override
        protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
                throws ServletException, IOException {

                            String username= request.getParameter("username");
                            String password= request.getParameter("password");

            }
}
  

 You can also send parameters from a link, e.g:  <a href="Servlet?nameOfParameter=valueOFparameter">

 There can be only one action  method (get/post etc.) for your form of  SearchPage.jsp .   

 You as a programmer have to decide first what and how the request needs to be process instead of letting users to choose between  doPost  and  doGet  methods.   

 Both the methods have different purposes check the difference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2349633/doget-and-dopost-in-servlets 

 You have to keep both the processing units A and B into a single servlet(servletA/servletB), 
 For example:  Call  Process A  first from JSP then call  Process B  from  Process A  and finally redirect/forward the response to  Welcome.jsp  from  Process B  
Below is the code: 

  Search.jsp  

  <form action="download result" method="get">
...
</form>
  

    

   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException 
      {
        ... //processing logic of A
        ... //processing logic of A
        ... //processing logic of A
        doPost(request,response);//call Post 
      }
 protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException 
  {
        ... //processing logic of B
        ... //processing logic of B
        ... //processing logic of B

        RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("welcome.jsp");  
        rd.forward(request, response);  
  }
  

  Note:  you can do viceversa, that is call  doPost  first and later  doGet  as per your requirement. Also, need to change  method="post"  in  form tag  for this. 

 

 For your query in comments use the below code: 

    

   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException 
      {
        ... //processing logic of A
        ... //processing logic of A
        ... //processing logic of A
        RequestDispatcher dispatcher = null;
        dispatcher=request.getRequestDispatcher("servletB");
        dispatcher.forward(request, response);//call Post 
      }
  

    

   protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException 
  {
        ... //processing logic of B
        ... //processing logic of B
        ... //processing logic of B

        RequestDispatcher rd=request.getRequestDispatcher("welcome.jsp");  
        rd.forward(request, response);  
  }

 There can be one way as below: 

  RequestDispatcher disp = request.getRequestDispatcher("shoppingCart.jsp"+"?myParam=myValue");
    disp.forward(request, response);    
  

 If you are fine with "GET" method then you can solve this problem with appended parameters.

  request.getParameter("name");
request.getParameter("value");
