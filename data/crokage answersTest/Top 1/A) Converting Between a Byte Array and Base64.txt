Query: Converting Between a Byte Array and Base64
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Why was the problem:  As someone already specified:
  If you start with a byte[] and it does not in fact contain text data, there is no "proper conversion". Strings are for text, byte[] is for binary data, and the only really sensible thing to do is to avoid converting between them unless you absolutely have to.  

  I was observing this problem when I was trying to create byte[] from a pdf file and then converting it to String and then taking the String as input and converting back to file.   

 So make sure your encoding and decoding logic is same as I did. I explicitly encoded the byte[] to Base64 and decoded it to create the file again. 

  Use-case: 
Due to some limitation I was trying to sent  byte[]  in  request(POST)  and the process was as follows: 

   PDF File >> Base64.encodeBase64(byte[]) >> String >> Send in request(POST) >> receive String >> Base64.decodeBase64(byte[]) >> create binary   

  Try this and this worked for me..  

  File file = new File("filePath");

        byte[] byteArray = new byte[(int) file.length()];

        try {
            FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
            fileInputStream.read(byteArray);

            String byteArrayStr= new String(Base64.encodeBase64(byteArray));

            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("newFilePath");
            fos.write(Base64.decodeBase64(byteArrayStr.getBytes()));
            fos.close();
        } 
        catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File Not Found.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        catch (IOException e1) {
            System.out.println("Error Reading The File.");
            e1.printStackTrace();
        }
