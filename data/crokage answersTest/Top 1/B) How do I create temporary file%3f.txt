   Temporary file is used to store the less important and temporary data,
   which should always be deleted when your system is terminated . The
  best practice is use the File.deleteOnExit() to do it. 
 

 For example, 

  File temp = File.createTempFile("abc", ".tmp"); 
temp.deleteOnExit();
  

 The above example will create a temporary file named “abc.tmp” and  delete it when the program is terminated or exited . 

 If you want  to delete the temporary file manually , you can still use the File.delete().
