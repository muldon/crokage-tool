 The problem with your code is that you are trying to read an empty file which you have just created. But you should have read the  multipart-file  to create the workbook. 

         FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fileLocation); // fis created with new file location 
        Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(fis); //creating a workbook with an empty file
  

 If you are trying to read from the workbook, You can directly make use of the  MultipartFile  object and be done with it. No need to create a new  File . 

 Do something like this. 

    Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(file.getInputStream());
  

 and then go on and work with the file. If you want to save the file somewhere, you can do it like, 

  try (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("/path/to/your/file/hello.xlsx")) {
            workbook.write(outputStream);
}
