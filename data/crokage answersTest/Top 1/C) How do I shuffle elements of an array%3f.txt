Query: How do I shuffle elements of an array?

 Shuffling the collection implies that there is some defined order of elements within, so elements can be reordered.  HashSet  is not an ordered collection as there is no order of elements inside (or rather details of the ordering are not exposed to the user). Therefore implementation wise it's does not makes much sense to shuffle  HashSet . 

 What you can do is add all elements from your  set  to the  ArrayList , shuffle it and get your results. 

  List<String> usersList = new ArrayList<String>(users);
Collections.shuffle(usersList);
// get 100 elements out of the list
