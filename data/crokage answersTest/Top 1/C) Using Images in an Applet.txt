Query: Using Images in an Applet
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rank:1 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30610852)
 Applets load images asynchronously, so it is likely the images are not fully loaded before the applet goes to paint.  But every Java component worth mentioning implements an  ImageObserver  that means it will get updates on image loading.  So to fix the problem, change this: 

  g.drawImage(pi, x, y, w, h, null);
  

 To  this:  

  g.drawImage(pi, x, y, w, h, this);
  

 Update 

 I mistakenly thought the  drawImage  method was part of the  JApplet  (which is an  ImageObserver ).  You might simply change the method declaration & painting line to: 

  public void draw(Graphics g, ImageObserver io) {
    g.drawImage(pi, x, y, w, h, io);
}
  

 Then to call it, change:  

  sd.draw(g);
  

   

  sd.draw(g, this);
