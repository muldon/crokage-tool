  .txt extension on your OS and your text file already exists then you can do even 

  Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"cmd.exe","/c","text.txt"});
  

 The advantage is it will take the program associated with .txt, what could be diferent from notepad.exe.

 If you have a text box to type the file path, just use sendkeys to input the file path and click on submit button. 
If there is no text box to type the file path and only able to click on browse button and to select the file from windows popup, you can use AutoIt tool, see the step below to use AutoIt for the same,  

 
  Download and Install Autoit tool from http://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/  
  Open Programs -> Autoit tool -> SciTE Script Editor.  
  Paste the following code in Autoit editor and save it as “filename.exe “(eg: new.exe) 

 Then compile and build the file to make it exe. (Tools → Compile)  
 

 Autoit Code: 

  WinWaitActive("File Upload"); Name of the file upload window (Windows Popup Name: File Upload)    
Send("logo.jpg"); File name    
Send("{ENTER}")
  

 Then Compile and Build from Tools menu of the Autoit tool -> SciTE Script Editor. 

 Paste the below Java code in Eclipse editor and save 

 Java Code: 

  driver.findElement(By.id("uploadbutton")).click; // open the Upload window using selenium    
Thread.sleep("20000"); // wait for page load    
Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rundll32 url.dll,FileProtocolHandler " + "C:\\Documents and Settings\\new.exe"); // Give  path where the exe is saved.

 The shortcut you see in your desktop is actually a file with the extension  . . It's real full path is, then: 

  C:\Users\Desktop\notepad.exe.
  

 Trying to run it through  exec()  will yield a   "CreateProcess error ... is not a valid Win32 application"   error. 

   

 Fortunately, you can run those as well through the http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html utility class. 

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("cmd", "/c",
                                      "C:\\Users\\robert\\Desktop\\notepad.");
  Process p = pb.start();
  p.waitFor();
}
  

   

 

 If you  must  use  Runtime.getRuntime().exec() , you can open the    file through  rundll32 : 

  Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rundll32 SHELL32.DLL,ShellExec_RunDLL " +
                                      "C:\\Users\\robert\\Desktop\\notepad.");
p.waitFor(); // watch out
  

 But keep in mind, by this approach, the  p.waitFor();  and similar method calls may not have the expected result: As you can see,  the created process is the  rundll32 , not the shortcut's ( notepad.exe ) .
