Query: How do I get the last element of SortedSet?

 A  Collection  is not a necessarily ordered set of elements so there may not be a concept of the "last" element.  If you want something that's ordered, you can use a  SortedSet  which has a  last()  method.  Or you can use a  List  and call  mylist.get(mylist.size()-1);  

 If you  really  need the last element you should use a  List  or a  SortedSet .  But if all you have is a  Collection  and you really, really,  really  need the last element, you could use  toArray()  or you could use an  Iterator  and iterate to the end of the list.   

 For example: 

  public Object getLastElement(final Collection c) {
    final Iterator itr = c.iterator();
    Object lastElement = itr.next();
    while(itr.hasNext()) {
        lastElement = itr.next();
    }
    return lastElement;
}

 As an alternative you can set listOfSources as a SortedSet 

  SortedSet<String> listOfSources = new TreeSet<String>();
  

 Then you can use  last()  method without casting to TreeSet 

  listOfSources.remove(listOfSources.last());
  

 I think that this is a preferred approach since you suppose that your Set has an order.

 You will need to cast back to TreeSet, as Set's don't have any order. 

  listOfSources.remove( ((TreeSet) listOfSources).last() );
