query : reason for java.lang.integer.integercache between 128 and 127

----Summary----
In Short Java And Most Modern Languages Do Not Represent Signed Integers Using Signedmagnitude Representation. In Other Words An 8bit Integer Is Not A Sign Bit Followed By A 7bit Unsigned Integer.
Just Wondering Why Between 128 And 127?.
A Larger Range Of Integers May Be Cached But At Least Those Between 128 And 127 Must Be Cached Because It Is Mandated By The Java Language Specification Emphasis Mine.
I Wrote The Following As This Problem Is Not Just Specific To Integer. My Conclusion Is That More Often Than Not If You Use The Api Incorrectly You Sill See Incorrect Behavior. Use It Correctly And You Should See The Correct Behavior.
When You Compile A Number Literal In Java And Assign It To A Integer Capital I The Compile Emits.
