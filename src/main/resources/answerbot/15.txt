query : sending file in chunks in java

----Summary----
It Could Be Done With Sax But I Think The Newer Stax Streaming Api For Xml Will Serve Your Purpose Better. You Could Create An Xmleventreader And Use That To Parse Your File Detecting Which Nodes Adhere To One Of Your Criteria. For Simple Pathbased Selection Not Really Xpath But Some Simple / Delimited Path You D Need To Maintain A Path To Your Current Node By Adding Entries To A String On New Elements Or Cutting Of Entries On An End Tag. A Boolean Flag Can Suffice To Maintain Whether You Re Currently In Relevant Mode Or Not.
Update.
When Going For Xslt You Ll Have All The Advantages Of A Full Xpath 1.0 Implementation Plus The Peace Of Mind That Comes From Knowing Xslt Is In Really Good Shape In Java. It Limits The Building Of The Input Tree To Those Nodes That Are Needed At Any Time And Is Blazing Fast Because The Processors Tend To Compile Stylesheets Into Java Bytecode Rather Than Interpreting Them. It Is Possible That Using Compilation Instead Of Interpretation Loses The Possibility Of Using Extension Elements Though. Not Certain About That. Extension Functions Are Still Possible.
Another Path Is Available If You Do Not Want To Code Too Much Consider Using File Upload Apache That Is Great !.
You Should Split The File In The Client And Restore Part Of The File In The Server. And After That You Should Merge The Files Together. Take A Look At Split /Merge File On Coderanch.
