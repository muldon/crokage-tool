query : tomcat memory exception

----Summary----
Check Out This Thread .
You Need To Increase The Permgen Space In Your Tomcat.
The Permanent Generation Is Special Because It Holds Metadata Describing User Classes Classes That Are Not Part Of The Java Language . Examples Of Such Metadata Are Objects Describing Classes And Methods And They Are Stored In The Permanent Generation. Applications With Large Codebase Can Quickly Fill Up This Segment Of The Heap Which Will Cause Java.Lang.Outofmemoryerror Permgen No Matter How High Your Xmx And How Much Memory You Have On The Machine.
While It May Be Something You Can Fix With The Tomcat Configuration What Code You Have Will Not Scale For Any Image. You Should Declare The Byte To Be A Fixed Size And Then Read And Write Until Youhave Consumed All Of The File Bytes.
Ok So I Found The Solution To The Problem. In Our New Version Of The Web App There Is A Context Parameter That Limits The Display Size Of The Results Sets And Paginates Them At That Limit. As I Said Earlier This Issue Only Seemed To Be Happening On Larger Result Sets. The Default Setting For Mysql Backends Is 500 But Apparently The Ms Sql Backend Needs This To Be Set Much Lower. Setting It To 20 Eliminated The Out Of Memory Errors. Thanks To All Who Offered Advice. It Was Greatly Appreciated.
