query : android.view.inflateexception binary xml file line #1 error inflating class android.widget.relativelayout

----Summary----
In Your Onviewcreated You Should Access The Fragment Ui Views With View.Findviewbyid Instead Of Getactivity .Findviewbyid . The Fragment Is Not Attached To The Activity Yet So It Is Not Found In The Activity Is View Hierarchy Either.
Caused By Java.Lang.Outofmemoryerror Bitmap Size Exceeds Vm Budget May Be The Real Culprit Here. Try Using Smaller Image To See If It Is A Memoryrelated Issue. Check Out These Links For Examples Of Similar Issues.
Check Your Drawable/Background_main I.E. The Background Image Of Your Root Layout The Vm Runs Out Of Memory When Decoding The Bitmap. Make The Image Dimensions Smaller.
The Problem Occurs Because The  Drawable/Background_main  Has A High Resolution Image. So When It Loads Then The  Vm Runs Out Of Memory  .
Ihave Solved The Same Problem By Reducing Dimension Of .Png Buttons In All Xml Files.
