query : how to send an image from web service in spring

----Summary----
As Per My Understanding Filesystemresource Used For Get The File System Using File System Uri But It Is Not Over The Http. Using Filesystemresource You Can Access Files From Your Local Machine To Local Accessible File System And From Server To Your Server Accesiable File System. But Could Not Access From Local To Server File System.

1 Thing Should That Add Something In To The Server Is Post/Update Request Not Get. In Spring By Default Method Handler Are Get Type. And Requestparam Are Not Good Approach If You Doing Post Request To The Serevr.
I Do Not Recommend Encoding Binary Data In Base64 And Wrapping It In Json. It Will Just Needlessly Increase The Size Of The Response And Slow Things Down.
Simply Serve Your File Data Using Get And Application/Octectstream Using One Of The Factory Methods Of Javax.Ws.Rs.Core.Response Part Of The Jaxrs Api So You Re Not Locked Into Jersey.
