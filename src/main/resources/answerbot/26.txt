query : how to iterate through columns rows of a multi dimensional array

----Summary----
It Is Creating List Points Of Two Dimensional Arrays Not Float S Which Is What You Need.
For It Is Ususally A Terrible Way To Check If Two Floating Numbers Are Equal. Floating Numbers Should Be Compared Using An Epsilon And You Should Always Keep Track Of The Error Propagation .
But Anyway You Should Know That Should You Find An Element That Would Match In The Remove Method You D Get An Unsupportedoperationexception Because Arrays.Aslist Simply Wraps Your Array And Your List Is Still Backed The Float Array. And You Cannot Resize Arrays.
Well You Probably Want Array_name.Length For Getting The Count Of The Rows And Array_name 0 .Length For The Columns. That Is If You Defined Your Array Like So.
In Java You Have To Be Explicit About When You Are Creating An Object. In This Case First We Check If There Is Already A Hashmap Object Stored In Our Outer Hashmap Under The Key En . If Not We Create An Empty One.
