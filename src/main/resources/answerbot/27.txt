query : is there an equivalent to asp.net web api in java world

----Summary----
You Should Keep In Mind That Tomcat Is Just One Of The Many Options Out There. If You Re Required To Use It For School/Work Then Go For It. But If You Have The Freedom To Chose Then I Would Recommend Using Google App Engine Java Tutorial Here Http //Code.Google.Com/Appengine/Docs/Java/Gettingstarted/ . Under The Hood They Use Derby I Think Most Of Google Is Products Run On Derby But I Do Not Know That For Sure .
For Most Of These There Is Not A 1 1 Equivalent. There Are Several Ides Eclipse Netbeans Idea Etc. Plenty Of Application Servers Jboss Bea Weblogic Etc. Web Frameworks Etc.
Javaland Is A Pretty Big Ecosystem. There Is Plethora Of Tools And Framework To Choose From And Combine.
Visual Studio Is An Ide Integrated Development Environment And It Does Not Just Support .Net. There Are Lots Of Others Eclipse Or Netbeans Are Popular Java Focused Ones.
Nhibernate Is Actually A Port Of Hibernate Which Is A Java Orm. There Are Plenty Of Other Java Orms Available Too See This Question . Most Are Based Around The Java Persistence Api Jpa .
