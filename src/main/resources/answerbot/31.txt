query : difference between object reference and object hash code

----Summary----
Two Different Objects Can Have Same Hashcode . A Reference Is A Unique Pointer To An Object Where Hashcode Is A Convenient Computed Attribute.
A Reference To An Object Is Just That. A Reference To An Object.
Is Typically Implemented By Converting The Internal Address Of The Object Into An Integer But This Implementation Technique Is Not Required By The Javatm Programming Language.
Edit From Peterj According To The Javase6 Object Specification If Oldcat.Equals Newcat Then The Hashcode Of The Two Should Be Equal. It Is Good Programming To Obey By That Contract.
No Youhave Pointed The Variables Vo1 And Vo4 At The Same Object Like This.
