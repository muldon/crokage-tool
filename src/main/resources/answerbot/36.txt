query : java 6 creating and detecting the first double value above long.max_value

----Summary----
The Max Positive Value Of Long Is 2 To The Power Of 63 1 Since Long In Java Is Signed And Therefore Can Hold Negative Integers. The Left Most Bit Is Reserved For The Sign Which Leaves 63 Bits For The Value Itself.
Out.Write Arr I Will Write Only The Lowest Byte Of Int. The Best Solution Is To Use Java.Io.Dataoutputstream Which Has Writeint Int Method.
It Is Not Only Equivalent To The Most Efficient Solution But It Makes It Pretty Obvious What Result You Should Expect.
This May Also Work Correction Of Your Example But Not Entirely Sure.
Although As Peterlawrey Suggested You Should Consider Using Double And Biginteger .
