query : can bufferedreader read bytes

----Summary----
Try With The Following.
Readline Returns Null After Reaching Eof .
Ok I Am Reading A .Docx File Via A Bufferedreader.
Well That Is The First Problem. Bufferedreader Is For Plain Text Files. Docx Files Are Binary Files In A Specific Format Assuming You Mean The Kind Of File That Microsoft Word Saves . You Ca Not Just Read Them Like Text Files. Open The File Up In Notepad Not Wordpad And You Ll See What What I Mean.
Adjust The Charset To Match The One You Used When Saving Your Text File Of Course If You Have The Option Of Using Utf8 That Is A Pretty Good Choice. Aside From Anything Else Pretty Much Everything Can Handle Utf8.
