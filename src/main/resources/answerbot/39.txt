query : how do i write logs and display them realtime in a java swing application

----Summary----
I Had This Problem Also But Solved By Using Ssh Y Instead Of X . Found On Forums That Some Java Applications Requires Trusted Y Ssh To Work Properly. Hope That Help Others.
My First Opinion Is That Showing A Joptionpane To The User Whenever The Text Field Focus Is Lost Could Be Very Annoying For Users. I Would Display An Error Message When The User Hits The Ok Button Of Your Form. The Error Message Could Contain A List Of All Error Messages Or Only The First One And Focus The Element With The Error.
I Would Have A Look At Jlayer Java 7 Or Jxlayer Java 6 Below.
Another Choice Would Be To Use Regular Jtextfield And Write Your Own Custom Validators. When Focus Changes Your Integervalidator Or Other Implementation Would Validate The Input String And The Ui Could Display An Error Or Warning Icon Next To The Field The Same As Some Web Applications Do.
Obviously If They Try And Submit The Form With Errors You Ll Want To Display And Error Message And Highlight The First Offending Field.
