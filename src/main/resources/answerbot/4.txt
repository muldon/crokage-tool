query : android httpclient hostname in certificate did not match <example.com> < .example.com>

----Summary----
The Certificate Verification Process Will Always Verify The Dns Name Of The Certificate Presented By The Server With The Hostname Of The Server In The Url Used By The Client.
This Httpclientbuilder.Create .Build  Will Return Org.Apache.Http.Impl.Client.Internalhttpclient . It Can Handle The This Hostname In Certificate Did Not Match Issue.
This Problem Is Described In Apache Httpclient Resolving Domain To Ip Address And Not Matching Certificate . It Appears To Be A Bug In The Version Of Httpclient You Are Using Where It Compares The Target Ip Instead Of The Target Hostname With The Subject Certificate. Please Use A Fixed Version Of Httpclient Instead.
Important If You Are Allowing All Hosts That Is Disabling Host Name Verification Then It Is Certainly Not Safe. You Should Not Be Doing This In Production.
Edit.
