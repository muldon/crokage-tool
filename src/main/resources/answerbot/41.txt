query : i and j not being initialized. but i already wrote int i and int j. what is wrong

----Summary----
It Is Up To You To Decide As Long As You Respect The Contract Of Comparator.
You Can Throw An Nullpointerexception . That Means That You Consider It A Bug To Pass Null To Your Comparator.
You Can Choose To Make Null Smaller Than Any Nonnull String. In That Case Compare Null Nonnull Must Return A Negative Integer Compare Nonnull Null Must Return A Positive Integer And Compare Null Null Must Return 0.
Local Variable Should Be Initialized Before Making Use Of The Variable .
Kindly Recheck The Code As I Could Not Able To Reproduce And Get The Same Error.
