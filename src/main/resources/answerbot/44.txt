query : how can i in a jsp page get maven project version number

----Summary----
Use A Filtered Properties File Containing The Line.
Or You Could Read The Maven Pom.Properties From Classpath. The Pom.Properties Are Located At Metainf/Maven/Groupid/Artifactid/Pom.Properties.
Use Standard Metainf Manifest.Mf Then You Can Use Java Code Getclass .Getpackage .Getimplementationversion To Get Version.
You Could Also Use A Groovy Script To Produce A Version Info File. I Like This Method More Because You Do Not Have To Exclude Stuff In The Assemblyplugin Is Descriptor. You Can Also Use This Method To Optionally Include Stuff Only Available If You Are Building From Jenkins/Hudson E.G. Check Oug Build_id Etc .
Mayber You Can Retrieve This In A Code And Get It On Your Jsp.
