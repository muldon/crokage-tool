query : simple way to repeat a string in java

----Summary----
You Can Look At Sorting The String Treat It As A Char Array And Then Do A Modified Binary Search Which Counts Occurrences? But I Agree With Tofutim That Traversing It Is The Most Efficient O N Versus O N Logn O Logn.
Since You Re Scanning The Whole String Anyway You Can Build A Full Character Count And Do Any Number Of Lookups All For The Same Bigoh Cost N.
A Character Frequency Count Is A Common Task For Some Applications Such As Education But Not General Enough To Warrant Inclusion With The Core Java Apis. As Such You Ll Probably Need To Write Your Own Function.
The Collections.Ncopies Call Creates A List Containing N Copies Of Whatever Value You Provide. In This Case It Is The Boxed Integer Value 1. Of Course It Does Not Actually Create A List With N Elements It Creates A Virtualized List That Contains Only The Value And The Length And Any Call To Get Within Range Just Returns The Value. The Ncopies Method Has Been Around Since The Collections Framework Was Introduced Way Back In Jdk 1.2. Of Course The Ability To Create A Stream From Its Result Was Added In Java Se 8.
The Code You Have Given Is Great It Just Needs To Be Tweaked A Little Bit. When You Create Your Swingworker You Should Keep Track Of It In An Instance Variable Maybe In A List If You Are Going To Be Wanting To Play Multiple Notes At Some Point? . Then Before Playing A New Note You Check To See If The Last Note Has Finished And If Not You Cancel It.
