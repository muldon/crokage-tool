query : oracle jdbc driver auto formatting the date column

----Summary----
The Full Info And It Is More Complex Than Described Here And Might Depend Upon Which Particular Version Of The Oracle Drivers Are In Use Is In Richard Yee Is Answer Here Now Expired Link To Nabble.
Java Doracle.Jdbc.V8compatible True Myapp Oracle Jdbc 11.1 Fixes This Problem. Beginning With This Release The Driver Maps Sql Date Columns To Java.Sql.Timestamp By Default. There Is No Need To Set V8compatible To Get The Correct Mapping. V8compatible Is Strongly Deprecated. You Should Not Use It At All. If You Do Set It To True It Wo Not Hurt Anything But You Should Stop Using It.
As Mentioned Above The 11.1 Drivers By Default Convert Sql Date To Timestamp When Reading From The Database. This Always Was The Right Thing To Do And The Change In 9i Was A Mistake. The 11.1 Drivers Have Reverted To The Correct Behavior. Even If You Did Not Set V8compatible In Your Application You Should Not See Any Difference In Behavior In Most Cases. You May Notice A Difference If You Use Getobject To Read A Date Column. The Result Will Be A Timestamp Rather Than A Date. Since Timestamp Is A Subclass Of Date This Generally Is Not A Problem. Where You Might Notice A Difference Is If You Relied On The Conversion From Date To Date To Truncate The Time Component Or If You Do Tostring On The Value. Otherwise The Change Should Be Transparent.
I Put Together Some Test Jdbc Code To Figure Out Exactly What Happens. The Results Were Interesting. Oracle Has Three Closely Related Datatypes Timestamp Timestamp With Time Zone And Timestamp With Local Time Zone . I Took The Exact Same Code And Ran It From Two Different Boxes One In The America/New_york Timezone And One Running On Utc. Both Hit The Same Database Running In Utc. I Was Using The Oracle 11.2.0.2.0 Driver.
This Article Which Is A Bit Older Indicates That Timestamp With Time Zone Is Pretty Much Useless If You Want To Do Anything Like Indexes Or Partitions. However It Seems Like Timestamp With Local Time Zone Might Be Extremely Useful. Not Sure What Happens If You Change The Server Is Time Zone But It Seems To Be Intelligent About Jdbc Clients Local Time Zones . I Have Not Had A Chance To Test Indexing Behavior Etc. With These Datatypes.
