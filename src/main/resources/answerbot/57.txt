----Summary----
There Are Three Main Containers In The Java Ee Stack The Web Container The Ejb Container And The Jca Container. Jca Is Meant To Provide Inbound And Outbound Connectivity With Thirdparty Systems Such As Database Jms Broker Or Others.
In Both Cases You Will Probably Need To Figure Out How To Temporary Store The Information Received By The Telnet Server The Centralized Store That You Mention That Will Later Be Displayed In The Web Interface. This Is Again Problematic With Java Ee Because The Spec Forbid The Usage Of Global State. For Instance You Should Not Use Static Field In Theory. But In Practice That Works If You Have Only One Instance Of Your App Running.
With Web Tools Platform You Are Also Able To Develop Java Se Applications Just Clicking One Button Change Perspective If You Want And It Becomes Like Eclipse For Java Se. So You Dont Need To Have 2 Versions Of Eclipse. Ialso This Conversation Can Be Helpfull For You What Is The Difference Between Eclipse For Java Ee Developers And Eclipse Classic . In Main Case It Is The Same Thing Only Including Extra Tools For Developing Ee Applications. Any Time You Can Extend It Using Plugins. So I Recommend You Download And Install Eclipse Ide For Java Ee Developers Which Already Includes The Web Tools Platform Wtp.
Even If I Know That This Will Be Controversial My Advice Would Be To Start With Java Ee 6 Only. So Grab Glasshfish V3 And Either Get The Book Beginning Java Ee 6 Platform With Glassfish 3 From Novice To Professional Or Follow The Java Ee 6 Tutorial . In My Opinion The Book That Ihave Started To Read So I Know What I Am Talking About Provides More Guidance Which Might Be Preferable If Everything Is New For You It Covers Both The Java Ee Platform And Its Apis And The Environment To Build Deploy Your Applications .
So Because I Think That Java Ee 6 Is A Big Improvement Over Previous Versions Of Java Ee Because It Provides Really Nice Standard Apis For All Your Needs Servlet 3.0 Jsf 2.0 Jpa 2.0 Ejb 3.1 Lite Bean Validation 1.0 Cdi Etc Because These Apis Are All More Than Decent Because There Is Nothing Really Wrong In Learning Them Because This Is Already A Big Task Because You Have To Start Somewhere I Would Focus On Java Ee 6 Only And Forget The Other Frameworks For Now. More Precisely I Would Start With The Java Ee 6 Web Profile And Then Add Things If You Want To Go Further .
