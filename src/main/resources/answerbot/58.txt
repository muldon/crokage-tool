query : xml to json using jsonlib

----Summary----
This Worked For Me With Jsonlib 2.4.
Update.
If I Understand Question Correctly I Think Jsonlib Is Unique In Its Assumption Of A String Being Passed Needing To Be Parsed. Other Libs Typically Treat It As String To Include With Escaping Of Doublequotes And Backslashes As Necessary I.E. Work As You Would Expect.
Jsonsimple Offers A Jsonobject.Escape Method.
Send The Entire Xml Document As String Instead Of Reading Line By Line.
