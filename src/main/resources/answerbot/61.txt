query : printing out with byte java

----Summary----
If You Do Not Want To Return Anything You Really Should Not Be Overriding The Tostring Method. You Should Probably Have A Separate Method Such As.
No You Do Not Need A For Loop.
Class Printstream Which Is What System.Out Is Has A Dedicated Method Overload Println Char Which Prints The Characters Of A Char Array.
I Do Not Know If This Will Solve Your Problem But Maybe It Will Point You In The Right Direction. The Trick About Encoding In Java Is Converting Strings To And From Byte Arrays.
Also As Far As I Understand The Numbers You Are Trying To Extract Are The Total And Used Numbers Of Computers Which Seem To Be The Trailing Numbers In The Avail Variable From The Js File After You Split It Where There Is A . If You Do Split There You Get Strings Like  Heslgfoa01 84 32  Which Essentially Seem To Come Down To Id Total Used . Thus If You Take That String Again And Split Into Its Elements Wherever You See A You Get An Array Of Three Elements Elm In The Code Below Id Heslgfoa01 Total 84 Used 32 . After That You Only Need To Convert Elements 1 And 2 To Ints To Get The Numbers!.
