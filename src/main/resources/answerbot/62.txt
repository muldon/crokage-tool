query : testing api which returns multiple values with junit

----Summary----
To Test Some Code You First Need To Make It Testable. Have You Ever Heard About Test Driven Delevelopment Tdd ?.
In The Example Above If Questions Is Null Then Junit Will Consider The Test Failed And You Can Know That Your Constructor Did Not Assigned The Question Set. On The Contrary If It Is Not Null Junit Will Consider It As A Success. The Assertnotnull Method Is Just One Example. You Can Find More Examples Here. Edit.
If You Ca Not Modify The Code I Think You Should Be Able To Query The Questions Field Of The Gameplay Class Instance. I Hope You Have Something Like Getquestions Method Or The Field Itself Is Public/Protected/Default Thus Accessible To The Junit Test Case.
Well There Are A Few Things To Comment There. The Assertion You Are Trying To Do Should The Object Was Correct Will Only Validate The Type Of The Payload Which Is Not Much Of An Assertion. May Be You Can Try To Do Some Sort Of Comparison. If You Just Need To Validate The Type Of The Payload I You Could Also Try The Method Isassignablefrom As It Will Cover The Class And Its Parent Check This Link Java Class.Isinstance Vs Class.Isassignablefrom .
Android Test Suites Are Based On Junit. You Can Use Plain Junit To Test A Class That Does Not Call The Android Api Or Android Is Junit Extensions To Test Android Components. If You Re New To Android Testing You Can Start With Generalpurpose Test Case Classes Such As Androidtestcase And Then Go On To Use More Sophisticated Classes.
