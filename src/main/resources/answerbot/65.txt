query : why the methods in object class are protected

----Summary----
I Cannot See Any Problem With Testing Protected Methods With Junit. As Long As Package Structure For Tests Mirrors Source Tree Structure Methods Other Than Private Are Visible For Tests.
Of Course If Implementation To Test Is Abstract You Have To Create Normal Subclass Of Class Under Test By Yourself Or Do It Via Some Mocking Library If Fits Better For Your Purposes . Also In Such A Case No Need To Create Layer Of Public Methods For Just For Calling Protected Visibility Methods. Only For Private Methods This Strategy Does Not Work. But Often Need To Test Private Methods Is Sign Of Design Problem Anyway.
Finalize Is Not Intended To Be Called From Outside Because It Shall Contain Code To Clean Up An Object Whilst Equals Tostring Wait Notify Are Intended To Be Called From Another Object To Ensure Equality A String Representation Or Other Functionality.
It Wo Not Compile Subclasses Only Have Access To Protected Methods On Other Objects Of The Same Type.
If You Cannot Find A Single Interface Or Abstract Class For Your Delegate Object That Contains All Methods You Want To Delegate There Will Be No Direct Way Neither For Extending Nor For Delegating Even If You Should Not Make Both .
