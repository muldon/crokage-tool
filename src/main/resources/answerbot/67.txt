query : jdbc connection from play app

----Summary----
20120403t18 16 05 00 00 App Web.1 Caused By Org.Postgresql.Util.Psqlexception Error Relation User_seq Does Not Exist.
Call This Method From Wherever You Need. Will Return True If Connection Exists Else False. You Can Show Your Alert Based On This.
To Use Tomcat Is Connection Pool You Must Copy The Jdbc Driver Is Jar Into Catalina_home/Lib As Documented So That The Driver Class Is Visible Through The Common Class Loader Or Dbcp Wo Not Be Able To Find It Hence The Classnotfoundexception . Tomcat Is Class Loaders Hierarchy Is Illustrated Below.
If You Do Not Have Control Over The Server Then You Re Lost. Just Create The Connection Pool Yourself Instead Of Letting The Container Do It.
I Had To Use Tomcat Dbcp 1.4 Older Version Because Of The Gae Frontend Not Allowing Threads To Live Outside Of Request Scope. Here Is An Example Project Https //Github.Com/Kennberg/Appenginejavaconnectionpool.
