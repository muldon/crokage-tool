query : how to dynamically split a comma separated string into string arrays splitting on nth comma

----Summary----
Try.
The Regular Expression.
Basically This Is Saying Split On A Comma Except Where That Comma Is Preceded By Two Backslashes. This Is Called A Negative Lookbehind Zerowidth Assertion .
Unless You Really Need To Diy You Should Consider The Apache Commons Class Org.Apache.Commons.Csv.Csvparser.
Upd According To Recent Changes In Question Logic It Is Better Not To Use Naked Split You Should Firstly Separated Text In Comma From Nonincommas Text Then Make Simple Split On The Last One. Just Use Simple For Loop And Check How Many Quotes Youhave Met Simultaneously Saving Characters Youhave Read Into A Stringbuffer. At First You Saving Your Characters Into Stringbuffer Until You Met Quotes Then You Put Your Stringbuffer Into Array Containing Strings That Was Not In Quotes. Then You Make New Stringbuffer And Saving Next Characters You Read Into It After Youhave Met Second Comma Youhave Stopping And Putting Your New Stringbuffer Into Array Containing Strings That Were In Commas. Repeating Until The End Of The String. So You Will Have 2 Arrays One With Strings That Were In Commas Others With Strings Not In Commas. Then You Should Split All Elements Of The Second Array.
