query : simpledateformat behaviour change in android marshmallow

----Summary----
Android Has A Builtin Base64 Class Which Can Be Used Starting From Api Level 8.
See The Comments On This Question Datepicker Crash In Samsung With Android 5.0.
This Is Due To A Bug In Android 2.1 Api 7 . It Seems That Android Programmers Missed Some Undocumented Java Behavior Which Is Classified As An Unfixable Bug Itself! In Their Implementation Of Android 2.1.
This Is Mentioned In Javadoc Of Dateformat#Parse.
As To The Mutability Of Simpledateformat Itself This Is Known For Years. You Should Never Create And Assign An Instance Of It As A Static Or Class Variable But Always As A Method Threadlocal Variable.
