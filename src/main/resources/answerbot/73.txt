query : hibernate bean validation on submit only

----Summary----
You Need To Set The Conversion Service In The Beanpropertybindingresult.
Removing This Jar Javax.Validation Validationapi 1.1.0.Final Solved My Problem. Make Sure U Have Only One Validation Jar. If We Have Two Jars Then They Conflict Resulting In Error.
Try Adding This Dependency To Your Pom.Xml.
The Nosuchmethoderror Indicate That You Have Loaded Wrong Version Of Jar That Tend To Have No Method Named Like Which You Have Used. I Highly Recommend You To Use Hibernate 4.0 Or Little Lower Which Turn Out To Be More Stable To Transplant.
I Filed A Bug Report For This Https //Hibernate.Onjira.Com/Browse/Hhh8028.
