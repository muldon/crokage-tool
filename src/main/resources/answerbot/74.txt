query : why is this code working without volatile

----Summary----
The Problem Is Here.
My_int Is An Integer Variable And When You Assign A New Value To It The Object That You Are Locking Here.
You Re Using While B In Print Method When You Should Use While Istrue . B Is A Local Variable That Is Not Updated While Istrue Is The Volatile Variable That Can Be Updated Externally. This Should Work.
Luiggimendoza Is Right You Should Not Try To Understand Volatile Before You Have Learned The Basic Features Of The Language Such As How Method Calls Work.
This Does Not Force The Ccprinting Thread To Actually Get To Run Immediately After The Flag Has Been Set To True . It Is Entirely Possible Especially On A Singlecore Machine That One Thread Sets The Flag And Prints The Message Before The Ccprinting Thread Even Had A Chance To Run.
