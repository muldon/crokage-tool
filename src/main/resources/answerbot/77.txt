query : how can i do something every second libgdx

----Summary----
You Can Try The Following Code.
If You Use A Camera Which You Should Changing The Coordinate System Is Pretty Simple.
Another Issue Was That Different Coordinate Systems Were Used In Different Parts Of Libgdx. Sometimes The Origin Of The Axes Was In The Bottom Left Corner With The Yaxis Pointing Upwards And Sometimes In The Top Left Corner Of The Sprite Pointing Downwards. When Drawing Meshes The Origin Was Even In The Center Of The Screen. This Caused Quite A Bit Of Confusion And Extra Work To Get Everything In The Correct Place On The Screen.
The Reasons We Use Yup By Default Which You Can Easily Change As Illustrated Above Are As Follows.
For Your Task At Hand You Might Not Even Need To Implement Inputprocessor. You Can Use The Input.Iskeypressed Method In Your Render Method Like This.
