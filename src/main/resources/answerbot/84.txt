If You Are Getting Message Your Android Sdk Is Out Of Date… — Click Configure —> Project Defaults —> Project Structure Pick Sdks —> Android Sdk And In A Build Target Choose Android 4.2.2 . Click Ok . Now It Should Work Fine.
Make Sure You Restart Android Studio.
Go To Your Android Studio Installation Folder And Locate The Bin Folder. Inside The Bin Folder You Will Find Studio.Bat . Execute The File And It Ll Show The Error. If It Is About The Java Path Then Follow The Tip 1.
