query : why does audiosystem.getaudioinputstream throw illegalargumentexception

----Summary----
Runtimeexception S Like Illegalargumentexception Are Used To Indicate Programming Errors . The Program Itself Should Rarely Be Able To Handle It. Someone Needs To Manually Fix The Code.
Since The Topic Of This Question Evolved Into  Correct Usage Of Illegalargumentexception And Nullpointerexception  I Would Like To Point Out The Strait Forward Answer In Effective Java Item 60 Second Edition.
You Can Use Valid4j With Hamcrestmatchers Found On Maven Central As Org.Valid4j Valid4j . The Validation Class Has Support For Regular Input Validation I.E. Throwing Recoverable Exceptions.
I Guess I Learned Something Again Here On So Thanks To Great Comments By Olivier Gr√©Goire Louis Wasserman Collind And Captain Man. The Standards Are Ussually A Strong And Sufficient Reason As They Make The Common Language Programmers Will Always Understand Correctly But In This Particular Case I Had This Little Doubt That Maybe This Rule Set Around Npe Is Not Too Ok. Java Is An Old Language And Some Of Its Features Came Up To Be A Bit Unlucky I Do Not Want To Say Wrong That Is Maybe Too Strong Judgment Like Checked Exceptions Although You May Also Disagree. Now I Think That This Doubt Is Resolved And I Should.
Arguably All Erroneous Method Invocations Boil Down To An Illegal Argument Or Illegal State But Other Exceptions Are Standardly Used For Certain Kinds Of Illegal Arguments And States. If A Caller Passes Null In Some Parameter For Which Null Values Are Prohibited Convention Dictates That Nullpointerexception Be Thrown Rather Than Illegalargumentexception . Similarly If A Caller Passes An Outofrange Value In A Parameter Representing An Index Into A Sequence Indexoutofboundsexception Should Be Thrown Rather Than Illegalargumentexception.
