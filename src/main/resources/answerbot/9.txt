query : how to programmatically set errorpage and etc web.xml parameters in spring

----Summary----
Please See Beandefinitionregistrypostprocessor.Postprocessbeandefinitionregistry Method Javadocs. This Is Exactly What You Are In Need Of Because It Lets You Modify Spring Is Application Context After Normal Bean Definitions Have Been Loaded But Before Any Single Bean Has Been Instantiated .
This Effectively Declares The Beans You Need And Injects Them Into Spring Is Application Context One Set Of Beans For Each Configuration. You Have To Rely On Some Naming Pattern And Then Autowire Your Beans By Name Wherever Needed.
I Done A Bit Of Research On This Topic And Found That For Some Of The Configurations Like Sessiontimeout And Error Pages You Still Need To Have The Web.Xml.
I Am Sure It Could Be Done Without Spring Boot As Well By Extending Springservletcontainerinitializer . It Seems That Is What It Is Specifically Designed For.
Servlet 3.0 Servletcontainerinitializer Designed To Support Codebased Configuration Of The Servlet Container Using Spring Is Webapplicationinitializer Spi As Opposed To Or Possibly In Combination With The Traditional Web.Xmlbased Approach.
