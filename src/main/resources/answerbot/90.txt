query : how to give execute permission for google appenginefile

----Summary----
I Would Go With The Doprivileged. Just Be Aware That Everybody That Has Access To Your Applet Can Download It And Put It On Their Site And Have Their Own Malicious Javascript Call It In Ways You Did Not Imagine.
The Accesscontroller.Doprivileged Considers The Protection Domain Of Just The Immediate Caller. In Your Example The Class Where Your Method Somemethodcalledfromjavascript Is Defined. If This A Trusted Class In The Signed Jar It Does Not Matter That The Untrusted Javascript Is Calling It.
In Theory You Should Be Able To Only Grant Your Java Codebase The Privileges It Needs Perhaps Access To Some Isolated Directory And Then Grant The Same Privileges To The Javascript Code That Will Use This Privileged Code But I Doubt Any Browser Has Such Features. I Am Surprised Javascript Even Runs In Another Protection Domain Than Java.
The Permission Is Not Associated With Your Program But With Who Which Account Runs This Program If It Is Being Executed By A System Account With Administrator Privileges Then The Program Will Have The Power To Perform I/O Operations Everywhere.
In Linux You Can Grant Isudo Access To Nonroot Users You Can Check If That Would Be An Option For You However It Seems Like A Risky Scenario You Might Want To Study This Use Case And Consider Specifying The Exact Permissions You Need Based On Your Needs.
