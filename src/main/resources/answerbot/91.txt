query : java why wo not this bigdecimal loop work

----Summary----
Your For Loop Goes For 5 Iterations Not 4. You Should Remove The From The Terminating Clause In Order To Get It Working. For Int I 0 I Numeros.Length I.
Java Right? Use Equalsignorecase Because You Could Be Typing Q And That / They Told You About Too Keep It In Mind.
Comparing Strings In Java Using Does Not Do What You Want. Use Calchoice.Equals Instead.
It Is Not.
You Re Basically Saying X Y . In This Case The Is Just A Matter Of Indicating It Is A Positive Integer. It Is Valid Code But It Is Not What You Intend.
