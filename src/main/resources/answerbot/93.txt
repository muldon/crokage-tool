query : is there a elegant and common way for converting postgresql hstore to jpa 2.1 datatype

----Summary----
How Are You Measuring Efficiency?.
For Example Storing The Uuid Which Is A Text Encoding Of A Byte As A Couple Of Long Values Will Allow You To Compare Them Very Quickly On A 64bit Architecture Much More Quickly Than String Comparison Which Is Characterbycharacter . However Your Coding Efficiency Would Suffer Because You Have To Write A Custom Type.
If I Use Jpa Eclipselink To Create Tables A String Type Results In A Varchar2 255 . How Could I Tell Jpa Via Annotation To Create A Varchar2 20 Attribute.
Bro I Had The Same Problem. Thing Is I Built A Query Builder Quite An Complex One That Build His Predicates Dynamically Pending On What Parameters Had Been Set And Cached The Queries. Anyways Before I Built My Query Builder I Had A Non Object Oriented Procedural Code Build The Same Thing Except Of Course He Did Not Cache Queries And Use Parameters That Worked Flawless. Now When My Builder Tried To Do The Very Same Thing My Postgresql Threw This Fucked Up Error That You Received Too. I Examined My Generated Sql Code And Found No Errors. Strange Indeed.
Postgresql Is Annoyingly Strict About Implicit Casts Between Textlike Types Like Json Xml Etc.
