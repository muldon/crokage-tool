query : how to run jacoco with java 7 and springinstrument

----Summary----
Well I Ca Not Tell You What The Exact Problem With Jacoco Is But I Can Show You How Try With Resources Is Compiled. Basically There Are A Lot Of Compiler Generated Switches To Handle Exceptions Thrown At Various Points.
No Real Question But Wanted To Throw More Research Out There. Tl Dr It Looks Like You Can Achieve 100% Coverage For Tryfinally But Not For Trywithresource.
Analysis Java7 Example If The Same 4 Tests Run Against The Java7 Style Example Jacoco Indicates 6/8 Branches Are Covered On The Try Itself And 2/2 On The Nullcheck Within The Try. I Tried A Number Of Additional Tests To Increase Coverage But I Can Find No Way To Get Better Than 6/8. As Others Have Indicated The Decompiled Code Which I Did Also Look At For The Java7 Example Suggests That The Java Compiler Is Generating Unreachable Segments For Trywithresource. Jacoco Is Reporting Accurately That Such Segments Exist.
No Using 1.8 Features In Your Source Code Requires You To Target A 1.8 Vm. I Just Tried The New Java 8 Release And Tried Compiling With Target 1.7 Source 1.8 And The Compiler Refuses.
In A 64bit System You Have 2 63bytes Of User Address Space But You Can Still Only Map The Amount Of Actual Memory You Have Physical Page File Mapped Files .
