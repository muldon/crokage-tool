query : how to choose lookandfeel from file

----Summary----
The Following Also Works For The Metal Laf Without Overriding The Createtooltip Method.
My Suggestion Is To Create Your Own Subclass Of Gtklookandfeel And Use That.
You Can Maintain A Arraylist Of Absolutefilepath And Remove Them From List When Internalframe Is Closed . I Have Updated Your Code.Please Check And Reply.
Ultimately You Have To Mess With The Color Schemes.
Since You Are Using The Graphite Glass Skin Messing With The Color Schemes Is Considerably Easier Since They Values Are Not Set In Java Code. If You Copy He File /Org/Pushingpixels/Substance/Api/Skin/Graphite.Colorschemes Into Your Classpath You Can Go Into The Various Scheme Definitions And Change The Colorforeground Entries To Be Whatever You Want. Possibly Black #Ffffff Or The Various Greys #Cccccc #999999 #666666 #333333 . But Since They Are Hex Colors You Can Do Whatever You Want.
