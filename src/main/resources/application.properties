#1 to 4. 
# 1- Run approach for external questions in two perspectives: with and without RACK. For each perspective, run steps 2 to 9 for each question using composer default weights and store posts according to the ranking order. Also, after step 6, store all related posts for each question.
# 2- Run internal survey to evaluate answers. For each perspective and for each question, retrieve the ranked  posts previously stored. Store the evaluation of each user.
# 3- Discover the best weights for the composer. For each question, retrieve the previously stored related posts, bootstrap weights, run steps 7 to 9 using each set of weights, build a ranked list and generate recall-rates and mrr. In the end, store the k best results and their weights. The best perspective may be discovered as well. Compare perspectives results. 
# 4- For each question in the best evaluated perspective (with or without RACK), retrieve the related posts previously stored, run steps 7 to 9 using the best weights for the composer and store the ranked list.
# 5- Run external survey to evaluate answers. Load each question and its ranked list and store users evaluations.
# 6- Use users ratings to generate recall-rates and mrr.
