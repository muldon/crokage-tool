about data scientists

rising alongside the relatively new technology of big data is the new job title data scientist .  while not tied exclusively to big data projects ,  the data scientist role does complement them because of the increased breadth and depth of data being examined ,  as compared to traditional roles . 
so what does a data scientist do ? 

a data scientist represents an evolution from the business or data analyst role .  the formal training is similar ,  with a solid foundation typically in computer science and applications ,  modeling ,  statistics ,  analytics and math .  what sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen ,  coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and it leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge .  good data scientists will not just address business problems ,  they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization . 
the data scientist role has been described as “part analyst ,  part artist . ” anjul bhambhri ,  vice president of big data products at ibm ,  says ,  “a data scientist is somebody who is inquisitive ,  who can stare at data and spot trends .  it ' s almost like a renaissance individual who really wants to learn and bring change to an organization . "
whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a crm system ,  for example – a data scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources .  the data scientist will sift through all incoming data with the goal of discovering a previously hidden insight ,  which in turn can provide a competitive advantage or address a pressing business problem .  a data scientist does not simply collect and report on data ,  but also looks at it from many angles ,  determines what it means ,  then recommends ways to apply the data . 
data scientists are inquisitive: exploring ,  asking questions ,  doing “what if” analysis ,  questioning existing assumptions and processes .  armed with data and analytical results ,  a top-tier data scientist will then communicate informed conclusions and recommendations across an organization’s leadership structure . 

data + context

drawing insight from a piece of data
involves understanding how it fits into the larger picture of an organization ,  explains ibm’s jeff jonas ,  distinguished engineer and chief scientist for ibm entity analytics .  business environments aren’t the only ones that require context; context is a necessity for any attempt to know more by examining data .
